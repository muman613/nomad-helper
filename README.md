Simply a tool to dump all nomad jobs and their allocation logs

## Description

I need a tool to dump all the nomad jobs and the log files. Here is an early peek at the 1st implementation of this tool. 
It is not tested nor is there any implied warranty that it won't fry your deployment. But initial tests indicate it works and
may provide someone in the world a starting place for iterating through jobs and allocations.
